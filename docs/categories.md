# Categories

!!! info
    For more detailed API specs, see our [OpenAPI Docs](https://app.herondata.io/docs)

## Defining categories
Category labels are defined manually by the customer during onboarding.

## Reading categories
You can view the labels of categories set for you by issuing a `GET` request to  `/categories`.
This will return a few fields, including a `heron_id` which is a unique
identifier generated by Heron Data for the category.

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://app.herondata.io/api/categories' \
    --header '<your-authorisation>'
```

Responses are of the form:

```json
{
    "categories": [
        {
            "label": "some_category",
            "created": "2020-11-23T17:46:56+00:00",
            "description": "some optional description",
            "heron_id": "ctg_nF5uQxLPBJn5RErH8QGeTH"
        }
    ]
}
```
