# Quickstart

## Credentials

To get started, please email `hello@herondata.io` for API credentials.

## Postman

The fastest way to start is to use our [Postman
Collection](https://postman.herondata.io/) with your credentials.

Simply open the collection in Postman, click the three ellipses on the right
hand side of the collection in the pane on the left, select "edit", then
"Authorization" and pick "Basic Auth" in the drop-down and enter your
credentials.

Post transactions to `/transactions` and see results!

By clicking the three ellipses in the middle pane and selecting "code", you
can see code snippets for the request you're currently making.
